## Zakum Jump Quest

This game takes inspiration (and sprites, lol) from the MMORPG Maplestory. You control a beginner character who is trying to make his way across the lava by jumping onto different magical floating platforms. What awaits at the end of the seemingly neverending platforms? 

Nothing. Death is the only way out. 

With that said, try your best to survive as long as possible! If you fall off and touch the lava, you die. Your score is displayed in the top left corner and increases at an increasing rate as the platforms slowly get faster and faster (aka the longer you last, the more points you get and the faster you accumulate points). Good luck!
